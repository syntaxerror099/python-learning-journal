# My Week One Reflections:

This week was pretty exciting. On the first day we learned a lot about how our computers work. We discussed the main parts of our computers like the CPU, GPU, RAM, and SSDs (or HDDs). 
Then we started to write code in Python. It was really exciting because I learned a lot of cool, new stuff. We learned about print, input, variables, the different data types, type casting, and using files.
We got to make small projects to help us understand how to use the stuff we learned about. We got to write code to convert Kilometers to miles and even build a simple Mad Libs game (which was really fun).
