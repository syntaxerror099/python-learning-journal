# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

## About Me:
I am currently 14 years old, and I am going to be a freshman in highschool in the fall. I'm currently taking CIST 005A and I am eager to learn more about python.
## Goals for This Course:
I've always been interested in learning how to program. I took a couple short classes online, and watched some tutorials but I never got to the time to continue learning. I'm excited to have the opportunity this summer to learn python. By the end of this class I hope to have a strong understanding of python, and be able to make some cool projects.
## My First Python Program

`````
print (Hello, World!)

`````
